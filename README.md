Coded in HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT




My first ever JavaScript project! Took time and effort, but you will never finish anything until you push through it! 

Please do not judge it, I have only been learning JavaScript for around a month now. Uploaded projects are to share with others and for easy to access code! 


**NOTE** Project was scaled to fit the device it was coded on!
